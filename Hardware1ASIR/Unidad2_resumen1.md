# Definition of a Computer System

A computer system is a set of components designed to receive data (input), process it, and produce a meaningful result (output). It consists of:

1. **Hardware**: The physical, touchable components, like the keyboard, mouse, monitor, motherboard, and hard disk.
2. **Software**: The intangible, logical components, including the operating system, applications, and data.
3. **Human Component**: The people involved in the design, management, and use of computer systems, including IT staff and users.

The primary parts of a computer system are the CPU, memory, input/output devices, and storage devices, working together as a single unit to produce desired outputs. Examples include smartphones, tablets, PCs, servers, and supercomputers.

# Von Neumann Architecture: Essential Concepts

The Von Neumann architecture, introduced by John von Neumann in 1945, is based on the stored-program concept, where instructions and data are stored together in one memory unit. This innovation allows computers to run various programs by simply loading them from memory, unlike early machines (e.g., ENIAC), which needed manual rewiring to change tasks.

## Core Components of Von Neumann Architecture

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Executes instructions and performs calculations.
2. **Memory Unit**: Stores both data and program instructions in the same space, enabling easy access and flexibility.
3. **Input/Output Devices**: Facilitate data exchange between the computer and external devices (e.g., keyboard, monitor).
4. **Buses**: Communication pathways that transfer data and instructions between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

This architecture is the foundation of most modern computers, enabling them to be general-purpose and versatile.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the main electronic circuit responsible for executing a computer program’s instructions and managing the overall system operations. Programs are sets of instructions written in programming languages (e.g., C#, Java) that need to be loaded into main memory (RAM) to be executed. The operating system translates these instructions into machine instructions that the CPU can interpret, performing tasks like addition, subtraction, or data loading. The set of machine instructions a CPU can handle is known as its instruction set and is unique to each processor.

### Key Components within the CPU

- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**: Executes arithmetic operations (e.g., add, subtract) and logical operations (e.g., and, or, not).
- **Control Unit (CU)**: Manages the operations of the ALU, memory, and I/O devices, directing them based on program instructions. It interprets program instructions, controls data movement between main memory and registers, and commands the ALU to perform specific operations.
- **Registers**: Small storage units within the CPU that temporarily hold data needed to execute instructions.

Modern CPUs may also include additional components, like cache memory and sometimes even a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which will be covered in further detail later.

### 3.1 Control Unit (CU)

- **Program Counter (PC)**: Register that contains the address of the next instruction to execute.
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: Register that holds the current instruction, with the operation code and involved data.
- **Decoder**: Extracts and analyzes the operation code from the current instruction and sends control signals for its execution.
- **CPU Clock**: Generates regular pulses that set the pace for executing instructions; its speed is measured in hertz (Hz).
- **Sequencer**: Executes machine instructions by creating basic micro-orders in each clock cycle.

### 3.1.2 Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)

- **ALU**: Performs logical, arithmetic, and bit-shifting operations on data received from the control unit.
- **Accumulator (AC)**: Special register that stores intermediate results of logical and arithmetic operations.
- **Status Register**: Indicates special conditions like negative results or overflow.
- **Floating Point Unit (FPU)**: Specialized circuit for performing mathematical operations with floating-point numbers, following the IEEE 754 standard for precision.

### 3.1.3 Registers

**Registers**: High-speed memory cells inside the CPU for storing temporary data, faster than conventional memory. Their size is based on the number of bits they handle (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64 bits).

#### Types of Registers

1. **User Accessible Registers**: Can be accessed by the user to optimize resource usage.
   - **Address Registers**: Hold memory addresses for data or instructions.
   - **Data Registers**: Hold data.
   - **Flag Registers**: Indicate conditions such as positive, negative, null results, or overflow.

2. **Internal Registers**: Used for CPU internal operations, not user-accessible.
   - **Program Counter (PC)**: Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.
   - **Instruction Register (IR)**: Holds the current instruction.
   - **Memory Address Register (MAR)**: Stores the address for reading or saving data.
   - **Memory Buffer Register (MBR)**: Holds data being read from or written to memory.

## 3.2 Buses

**Buses**: Electrical or optical lines transmitting data between components like the CPU and memory, carrying groups of bits for communication.

### Types of Buses

- **Data Bus**: Transmits data between the CPU, main memory, and I/O devices. Speed is measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). Word size (number of bits transferred simultaneously) is often 64 bits, enabling 8 bytes per clock cycle.
- **Address Bus**: Carries memory addresses between the CPU and memory for accessing specific locations. A 32-bit address bus, for example, can address 4 GB of memory.
- **Control Bus**: Sends control signals to coordinate all system activities.

## 3.2 Memory Unit

The **Memory Unit** mainly consists of RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory). RAM stores data and instructions for active programs, enabling quick CPU access.

### Characteristics of RAM

- **Volatile**: Loses data when the computer is turned off.
- **Memory Cells**: Stores one word of data each, with unique memory addresses. Word size varies (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64 bits) based on the microprocessor.
- **Random Access**: Data can be read/written without sequential order.

### Memory Operations

- **Memory Address Register (MAR)**: Stores the address of the memory cell to access.
- **Memory Buffer Register (MBR)**: Holds data being read/written to memory.
- **Control Unit**: Manages read/write operations by moving data between MAR and MBR.

## 3.25 Input and Output Unit (I/O Unit)

**I/O Unit**: Facilitates the exchange of information between the computer and external devices.

### Types of Peripherals

- **Input Peripherals**: Devices sending data to the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, webcam).
- **Output Peripherals**: Devices receiving data from the computer (e.g., monitor, printer).
- **Input/Output Peripherals**: Devices that send and receive data (e.g., touch screen).
- **Storage Peripherals**: Store data (e.g., hard drives, DVD drives, USB sticks).
- **Communication Peripherals**: Enable communication (e.g., network cards, Bluetooth cards).

### I/O Unit Function

The I/O unit interfaces between the CPU and peripherals, addressing speed and data format differences to ensure effective communication.

### I/O Modules

- **Peripheral Controllers**: Manage communication with the CPU.
- **I/O Ports**: Connect peripherals to the computer’s buses.

# CPU Features

- **Clock Speed**: Measures how many cycles the CPU executes per second, typically in gigahertz (GHz).
- **Instruction Set**: The collection of machine instructions a CPU can process. Some CPUs feature simpler instruction sets for basic operations, while others can handle both simple and complex operations, with complex operations often being slower.
- **Word, Data Bus, and Address Bus Size**: The size of these components determines how much data or address information the CPU can handle simultaneously.

## Memory Hierarchy

Memory in a computer system is organized in a hierarchy based on capacity, access speed, and cost per bit:

1. **CPU Registers**: Small, high-speed memory integrated into the CPU, used during instruction execution. They offer low capacity but very high speed.
2. **Cache Memory**: A fast memory that stores frequently accessed data and instructions, serving as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. This helps reduce data access time by avoiding slower RAM reads.
3. **Main Memory (RAM)**: Stores active program instructions and data. It has a larger capacity than cache but operates at a slower speed.
4. **Secondary Memory**: Provides permanent storage for data and programs. It has much greater capacity than main memory and is non-volatile, though slower. Examples include hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and optical media (CD/DVD).
